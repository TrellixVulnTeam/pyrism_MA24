### Pycharm:
If you are using pycharm you have to install a plugin called "EnvFile".

EnvFile lets you set global environment variables for your projects in .env files that your scripts can inherit from.

#### The variables this project needs are:

- **PYSDL2_DLL_PATH**: *path to an SDL2 devel dll.*
- **VS140COMNTOOLS**: *path to Visual C++ 2015 compiler tools. 
This may already been set by the installer.*
